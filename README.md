# multi-hybrid-cloud-2
Hello WorldðŸ˜Ž



In my first article on cloudcomputing. I have created End-to-End automation for deploying our services on cloud service with CDN (Content Delivery Network). I have used Amazon Web Services (AWS) and terraform to make this Infrastructure as a Code. 

What new thing you will get here is, I have configured cloudfront, this is a aws service for CDN. This will scale your website world wide, this means any person from any part of the world will able to access the website with almost nill latency or delay.



What all things this will provide:

âœ” Launch ec2 instance with httpd, git, php and made the httpd service enabled.

âœ” Creating EFS volume and mounting it to /var/www/html.

âœ” Creating Security Group for instance.

âœ” Download Code from github and downloading it in /var/www/html

âœ” Creating S3 bucket and adding static content of website to it.

âœ” Using cloud front make it globally available in whole world.
